### BashOS

There is a very minimal busybox base operating system that you can write/run bash script on it.

A small and minimal linux that can run bash script and some other tools

The goal of this project is learning (maybe make a minimal OS just for running bash scripts)

for using this, you can run the following code (chroot run currently):
```bash

make run

```

### TODO

1. make BashOS bootable
